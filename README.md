## 🚧 CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION 🚧

## List of Materials 📜

## Why?  
When you have a bunch of spare parts sitting around and not really doing anything, it becomes pretty enticing to just build another machine 🤷 Plus, it's fun.

## Shoutouts 📣
I would like to give a sincere thank you to these folks whose creativity helped spark a bit of my own.
